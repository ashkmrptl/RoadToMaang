/**
 * Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M describing a maze. The maze consists of empty locations and walls.
 * 1 represents a wall in a matrix and
 * 0 represents an empty location in a wall.
 * There is a ball trapped in a maze. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right,
 * but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall (maze boundary is also considered as a wall). When the ball stops,
 * it could choose the next direction.
 * Given two array of integers of size B and C of size 2 denoting the starting and destination position of the ball.
 * Find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty
 * spaces traveled by the ball from the starting position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot
 * stop at the destination, return -1.
